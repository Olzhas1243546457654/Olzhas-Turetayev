                <h1>Sun</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System.</li>
                    <li>It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, primarily composed of hydrogen and helium.</li>
                    <li>The Sun's energy is generated through nuclear fusion reactions in its core, where temperatures
                        reach millions of degrees Celsius.</li>
                    <li>It is the primary source of light and heat for the planets in the Solar System, including Earth.
                    </li>
                    <li>The Sun's surface, known as the photosphere, has a temperature of about 5,500 degrees Celsius.
                    </li>
                    <li>It has several layers, including the core, radiative zone, convective zone, and atmosphere
                        (including the chromosphere and corona).</li>
                    <li>The Sun's magnetic activity causes phenomena such as sunspots, solar flares, and coronal mass
                        ejections.</li>
                    <li>Its distance from Earth is about 93 million miles (150 million kilometers), and it takes light
                        about 8 minutes and 20 seconds to reach Earth from the Sun.</li>
                    <li>The Sun is approximately 4.6 billion years old and is about halfway through its main sequence
                        stage of life.</li>
                    <li>It will eventually exhaust its nuclear fuel and undergo a series of changes, eventually becoming
                        a red giant and then a white dwarf.</li>

                <h1>Mercury</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>Mercury is the smallest and innermost planet in the Solar System.</li>
                    <li>It has a very thin atmosphere, primarily composed of oxygen, sodium, hydrogen, helium, and
                        potassium.</li>
                    <li>Surface temperatures on Mercury vary dramatically, ranging from extremely hot during the day to
                        extremely cold at night due to its lack of atmosphere to retain heat.</li>
                    <li>Mercury's surface is heavily cratered and has extensive plains, cliffs, and ridges.</li>
                    <li>The planet has a relatively large iron core, making it one of the most metal-rich planets in the
                        Solar System.</li>
                    <li>Mercury's orbit is highly elliptical, and it has the shortest orbital period of any planet,
                        completing a trip around the Sun in about 88 Earth days.</li>
                    <li>It lacks moons and rings.</li>
                    <li>Mercury's rotation is unique; it has a 3:2 spin-orbit resonance, meaning it rotates three times
                        about its axis for every two revolutions around the Sun, which results in a peculiar pattern of
                        sunlight distribution on its surface.</li>
                    <li>The planet was named after the Roman messenger god Mercury due to its fast orbit around the Sun.

                <h1>Venus</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>Venus is the second planet from the Sun, located between Mercury and Earth.</li>
                    <li>It is often called Earth's "sister planet" due to its similar size, composition, and proximity.
                    </li>
                    <li>Venus is sometimes referred to as the "morning star" or the "evening star" because it is visible
                        to the naked eye from Earth and can be seen just before sunrise or just after sunset.</li>
                    <li>It has a thick atmosphere primarily composed of carbon dioxide, with clouds of sulfuric acid,
                        making it the hottest planet in the Solar System with surface temperatures that can reach up to
                        471 째C (880 째F).</li>
                    <li>Venus rotates very slowly on its axis, taking about 243 Earth days to complete one rotation, but
                        its day (from one sunrise to the next) is shorter, about 117 Earth days.</li>
                    <li>Due to its thick atmosphere, Venus experiences a runaway greenhouse effect, trapping heat and
                        maintaining its extremely high temperatures.</li>
                    <li>Its surface is mostly covered in smooth plains, volcanic features, and highland regions, with no
                        evidence of plate tectonics.</li>
                    <li>Venus has no moons and no magnetic field.</li>
                    <li>It has been extensively studied by spacecraft, including the Soviet Venera missions and NASA's
                        Magellan spacecraft, which mapped its surface in detail using radar.</li>
                    <li>Venus is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Earth is the third planet from the Sun, situated between Venus and Mars.</li>
                    <li>It is the largest and densest of the inner planets and the only known planet in the universe to
                        support life.</li>
                    <li>Earth has a diverse range of ecosystems, including oceans, forests, grasslands, deserts, and
                        polar regions, which support a vast array of plant and animal species.</li>
                    <li>The planet's atmosphere consists primarily of nitrogen (about 78%) and oxygen (about 21%) with
                        trace amounts of other gases such as carbon dioxide, argon, and water vapor.</li>
                    <li>Earth's surface is approximately 71% water-covered, with the remaining 29% consisting of
                        continents and islands.</li>
                    <li>It has a solid iron inner core surrounded by a liquid outer core, which generates a magnetic
                        field that protects the planet from harmful solar radiation.</li>
                    <li>Earth rotates on its axis, completing one full rotation approximately every 24 hours, causing
                        day and night cycles.</li>
                    <li>The planet orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 93 million miles (150 million
                        kilometers), completing one orbit roughly every 365.25 days, which defines one Earth year.</li>
                    <li>Earth's axial tilt is responsible for the changing seasons as different parts of the planet
                        receive varying amounts of sunlight throughout the year.</li>
                    <li>It has one natural satellite, the Moon, which plays a significant role in Earth's tides and has
                        been explored by both crewed and robotic missions.</li>
                    <li>Earth's name is derived from Old English and Germanic words meaning "ground" or "soil."</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun, located between Earth and Jupiter.</li>
                    <li>It is often referred to as the "Red Planet" because of its reddish appearance, which is caused
                        by iron oxide (rust) on its surface.</li>
                    <li>Mars has a thin atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide, with traces of nitrogen and argon.
                    </li>
                    <li>Surface features on Mars include vast deserts, polar ice caps, canyons, mountains, and extinct
                        volcanoes, including Olympus Mons, the tallest volcano and mountain in the Solar System.</li>
                    <li>The planet experiences extreme temperature variations, with average surface temperatures around
                        -63째C (-81째F) and lows down to -140째C (-220째F) near the poles.</li>
                    <li>Mars has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos, which are thought to be captured asteroids.</li>
                    <li>It has a thin atmosphere that does not provide significant protection from solar radiation or
                        retain heat well, making it inhospitable for life as we know it.</li>
                    <li>Water exists on Mars in various forms, including ice caps, polar ice, and potentially subsurface
                        ice, suggesting the possibility of past or present liquid water on the planet.</li>
                    <li>Mars has been extensively explored by robotic spacecraft, including orbiters, landers, and
                        rovers, with ongoing missions searching for evidence of past life and preparing for future human
                        exploration.</li>
                    <li>The planet's name comes from the Roman god of war, likely due to its reddish appearance
                        resembling blood.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest planet in the Solar System.</li>
                    <li>It is a gas giant with no solid surface, primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, similar to
                        the composition of the Sun.</li>
                    <li>Jupiter's atmosphere is characterized by colorful bands of clouds and a giant storm known as the
                        Great Red Spot, which is a persistent anticyclonic storm larger than Earth.</li>
                    <li>The planet has a strong magnetic field, making it the largest and most powerful magnetosphere in
                        the Solar System.</li>
                    <li>Jupiter has a large system of moons, with over 80 known satellites, including the four largest
                        moons known as the Galilean moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto.</li>
                    <li>It has a rapid rotation, completing one day in just under 10 hours, resulting in an oblate shape
                        with a noticeable bulge at the equator.</li>
                    <li>Jupiter has been visited by several spacecraft, including the Galileo probe, which orbited the
                        planet from 1995 to 2003, and the Juno spacecraft, which has been in orbit around Jupiter since
                        2016, studying its atmosphere, magnetic field, and interior structure.</li>
                    <li>The planet's immense size and gravitational influence have a significant impact on the dynamics
                        of the Solar System, influencing the orbits of other planets and celestial bodies.</li>
                    <li>Jupiter's name comes from the king of the Roman gods, equivalent to the Greek god Zeus.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest planet in the Solar System, after
                        Jupiter.</li>
                    <li>It is a gas giant with no solid surface, primarily composed of hydrogen and helium.</li>
                    <li>Saturn is known for its spectacular ring system, which consists of nine continuous main rings
                        and three fainter discontinuous rings.</li>
                    <li>The rings are made up of billions of icy particles ranging in size from tiny grains to large
                        boulders.</li>
                    <li>Saturn has a relatively low density, making it the only planet in the Solar System that is less
                        dense than water.</li>
                    <li>It has a complex atmosphere with bands of clouds and a hexagonal-shaped jet stream at its north
                        pole.</li>
                    <li>Saturn has more than 80 moons, with the largest being Titan, which is larger than the planet
                        Mercury and has a dense atmosphere.</li>
                    <li>The planet has been visited by spacecraft, including the Cassini-Huygens mission, which orbited
                        Saturn from 2004 to 2017, providing detailed observations of the planet, its rings, and its
                        moons.</li>
                    <li>Saturn has a strong magnetic field and emits radio waves, which are thought to be generated by
                        interactions between its magnetic field and charged particles from the Sun.</li>
                    <li>Its name comes from the Roman god of agriculture and wealth, equivalent to the Greek god Cronus.

                <ul>
                    <li>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and the third-largest planet in the Solar System.</li>
                    <li>It is an ice giant, consisting mainly of elements such as hydrogen, helium, and methane.</li>
                    <li>Uranus is unique among the planets because it rotates on its side, with its axis of rotation
                        tilted at an angle of about 98 degrees relative to its orbit around the Sun.</li>
                    <li>Because of this extreme tilt, Uranus experiences extreme seasonal variations as different parts
                        of the planet receive varying amounts of sunlight during its 84-year-long orbit.</li>
                    <li>The planet's atmosphere is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, with traces of methane
                        that give it a blue-green color.</li>
                    <li>Uranus has a system of faint rings and a diverse range of moons, with the largest ones being
                        Titania, Oberon, Umbriel, Ariel, and Miranda.</li>
                    <li>It has been visited by only one spacecraft, Voyager 2, which flew by Uranus in 1986 and provided
                        valuable data about the planet's atmosphere, rings, and moons.</li>
                    <li>Uranus has a relatively weak magnetic field compared to other gas giants like Jupiter and
                        Saturn.</li>
                    <li>Its name comes from the Greek god of the sky, Uranus, the father of Cronus (Saturn) and
                        grandfather of Zeus (Jupiter).</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Neptune is the eighth and farthest planet from the Sun in the Solar System.</li>
                    <li>It is classified as an ice giant, similar to Uranus, and is primarily composed of hydrogen,
                        helium, and traces of methane.</li>
                    <li>Neptune's atmosphere is known for its deep blue color, which is caused by methane absorbing red
                        light and reflecting blue light.</li>
                    <li>The planet has the strongest winds in the Solar System, with wind speeds reaching up to 1,500
                        miles per hour (2,400 kilometers per hour) in its equatorial region.</li>
                    <li>Neptune has a system of faint rings and a diverse range of moons, with the largest ones being
                        Triton, which is one of the few moons in the Solar System to orbit its planet retrograde, and
                        Proteus, which is one of the largest irregularly shaped moons in the Solar System.</li>
                    <li>It has been visited by only one spacecraft, Voyager 2, which flew by Neptune in 1989 and
                        provided valuable data about the planet's atmosphere, rings, and moons.</li>
                    <li>Neptune has a faint, incomplete ring system composed of dust particles and small rocks.</li>
                    <li>It has a magnetic field tilted relative to its rotation axis, with a magnetic field strength
                        similar to that of Uranus but offset from the planet's center.</li>
                    <li>Its name comes from the Roman god of the sea, Neptune, equivalent to the Greek god Poseidon.
                    </li>
